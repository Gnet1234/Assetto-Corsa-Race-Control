# Assetto-Corsa-Race-Control
The goal of this project is to make assetto corsa more interactive by adding a race control through the use of python. I wanted to make either an Language Model or a dynamic system that can react to changes in a race and then say something to the driver. A good example would be how Prez (Robin Kuo) from project wingman interacts with the player.
